/**
 * $LUNA INU - LUNA INU
 *
 * In crypto, the success of a strong community has led countless individuals 
 * to a life of financial freedom; many of whom would have stayed poor forever,
 * even if they worked every day saving each penny until the day they died.
 *
 * The rise of Shiba INU caused a cultural and monetary shift in the world on levels
 * never seen before. Thousands of "Something-Inu" tokens have launched since then 
 * attempting to capitalize on both whatever the current "trend" is as well as those 
 * hoping to buy in early on the "NEXT SHIBA INU", thus destroying trust in the INU name 
 * and the promises that came along with it.
 *
 * Today, even Shiba INU itself has strayed far away from the original vision its creator 
 * intended.
 *
 * Filling up the market with these "Trend-INU" tokens has left many hopeful investors burned
 * and rugged, and has fractured the Memecoin community as a whole. Nowadays, building the 
 * "Next Shiba INU" feels like an impossible task, as there is seemingly no place for the 
 * laymen to come together and build outside of trend-chasing dog coins with dev teams who 
 * always let their communities down.
 *
 * Until now.
 *
 * LUNA INU is a safe haven for all.
 *
 * A token with no team, no dev, no tax, no temporary meme trend name, no expectations past what
 * YOU (the community) bring to the table.
 *
 * LUNA INU represents the lost memories of a time when community was truly all that was needed for
 * generations of riches to be created.
 *
 * Liquidity has been burned upon creation, 50% of supply has been burned, there is no official
 * site, telegram, twitter, logo, or anything past the INU contract itself.
 *
 * It is up to YOU, the individual, to bring glory and wealth back to the LUNA INU name.
 *
 * All hail the LUNAINU
 *
 * Tax: buy 2% sell 2%
